Hello Prakash

Alina D(15:52:50)
I can see that you referred to the previous chat id, however, do you have a case number for that issue?

Alina D(15:54:05)
I think that I got your case#2050713, is that correct?

Prakash Babu(16:02:45)
Hi

Prakash Babu(16:03:08)
#2050713

Prakash Babu(16:03:13)
yes you are right

Alina D(16:04:41)
ok, and I can see the latest update from previous engineer. She suggested to check forwarding options for bdas@broadsoft.com to see if there any forwarding set up from gmail to mcafee.

Alina D(16:04:51)
Can you please confirm?

Prakash Babu(16:05:16)
we have verified and we dont see any forwarding's

Alina D(16:07:46)
let me please take a look at the message tracking on the HUB server. It can take several minutes, I will keep you posted.

Prakash Babu(16:13:20)
fine

Prakash Babu(16:14:28)
i just gone through that emails and found it's generating from the queue

Prakash Babu(16:15:47)
if possible you can clear the log, as i read the message it says it's retrying for 5days if deliver fails

Alina D(16:16:14)
Yes, the same I can see on our HUB server. That there were several attempts to deliver the email, however, it was not delivered.

Alina D(16:16:26)
I would need to clarify it with our L2 support

Alina D(16:16:39)
As I do not see the error on HUB

Prakash Babu(16:17:05)
yes, as today i have checked with stopping forward from my other server and checked only forward from mportal account i see a success mail which doesn't get a failure

Alina D(16:18:09)
Prakash, and can you please verify really quick if the user bdas@broadsoft.com is experiencing any issues with the email delivery from other users?

Prakash Babu(16:20:10)
nope there is no email delivery

Prakash Babu(16:20:53)
you can see there is mail failure only on 10th & 11th nov 2015

Alina D(16:31:13)
Prakash, I have reviewed headers again, and the error that is generated comes from your 3rd party Mcafee. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the console, as it is not hosted with us.

Alina D(16:31:43)
Please, take a look at the following info from the Mcafee kb article: https://support.mcafeesaas.com/MCAFEE/_cs/AnswerDetail.aspx?sSessionID=6624964101NEXPGIICTZZBKOIXKSKENPFQHWVYLX&inc=31043&caller=~%2FFindAnswers.aspx%3FtxtCriteria%3D877%26sSessionid%3D6624964101NEXPGIICTZZBKOIXKSKENPFQHWVYLX

Alina D(16:32:59)
please, try the following workaround: Outbound: Correct the outbound smart host setting on the email server.  Check that your Smart Host name is spelled correctly on the sending server. To verify the proper spelling go to Email Protection > Setup > Outbound Servers

Prakash Babu(16:34:45)
where can i see this email protection

Alina D(16:38:14)
The login page should be the following: https://portal.mcafeesaas.com/

Prakash Babu(16:40:33)
thanks let us check that, is it possible to clear the log in your server so the end user doesn't get the alert mails agatin

Alina D(16:43:34)
Sure, please check and let us know! However, I am afraid that we would not be able to clear the log, as the notification was not generated by our server.

Prakash Babu(16:46:43)
ok

Prakash Babu(16:47:29)
please confirm is the settings for global users or a particular user i need to verify as we see only the issue with particular user

Alina D(16:49:39)
so, in this case, please follow the KB: https://support.mcafeesaas.com/MCAFEE/_cs/AnswerDetail.aspx?sSessionID=6624964101NEXPGIICTZZBKOIXKSKENPFQHWVYLX&inc=31043&caller=~%2FFindAnswers.aspx%3FtxtCriteria%3D877%26sSessionid%3D6624964101NEXPGIICTZZBKOIXKSKENPFQHWVYLX and it refers to the outbound policy set up
